Game Description:///////////////////////////////////////

The aim is to survive for as long as you can and raise your score
by building "Blocs" along the path to your homeland to shoot down
waves of enemies. Building and upgrading Blocs costs money. The
more enemies you kill, the more money and score points you earn!

You can have a maximum of 10 Blocs at one time, so good placement is key.

If an enemy slips past you will lose a health point.
health points don't regenerate and if you lose all of them, 
it's game over.

You can sell Blocs back for a reduced price if you need money quick.

Be careful though! As the game progresses, each wave will be
more and more difficult and unforgiving. For example, after a while
level 1 Blocs will become fairly useless.

There are 20 waves in total. Every five waves there will be a 
considerable raise in difficulty, see if you can beat all 20.
It is possible!

Blocs can be upgraded twice.(but it costs more than just building
a new Bloc)


Select a control on the menu at the top of the screen:

	Build:  When selected you will see a red or green square 
	        follow your mouse. Click somewhere on the map
		to build a tower. A red square means you can't
		build a tower, this could be due to obstruction
		or you might not have enough money.

		250 (money) to build a Bloc

	Sell:   When selected you will see a purple box around the cursor.
		You can sell any placed tower for less than it costs.

		Bloc level 1 - Sells for 125
		Bloc level 2 - Sells for 375
		Bloc level 3 - Sells for 750
		(They sell for half of what you last paid for them)

	Lvl Up: When selected you will see a blue box follow your cursor.
		With this selected you can upgrade a level 1 or 2 Bloc.
		Provided you have the funds.
		
		750 to upgrade a level 1 Bloc
		1500 to upgrade a level 2 Bloc
		
The player starts with:

100 health
750 money
5 seconds to prepare.

Have fun!
